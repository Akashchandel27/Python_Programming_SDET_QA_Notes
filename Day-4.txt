List
------------------------------
A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable.

to add in the list something--

mylist = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
mylist.append("orange")        # adding new items at the end of the list
print(mylist)                  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

mylist.insert(1,"orange")  # adding where ever you want to add in the list
print(mylist)              # ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'cherry']
pop() to 

Tuple
------------------------------
A list is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
In Python lists are written with round brackets ().
List is Immutable.

if is it immuatable below things are not possiable...

1) We cannot modify existing value.
2) We cannot append new value.
3) We cannot insert a new value.
4) We cannot remove any value


we can change the value but for that we need to change the

-> list in tuple
-> Then, change tuple into list.
